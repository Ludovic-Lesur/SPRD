# Abstract
The SPRD was design to ring an alarm as soon as rain is detected on a remote sensor (resistive button for instance). This device can be useful to put some stuff outdoor (clothes for instance) while the weather is uncertain.

# Hardware
The board was designed on **Circuit Maker V1.3**. Hardware documentation and design files are available @ https://workspace.circuitmaker.com/Projects/Details/Ludovic-Lesur/SPRDHW1-0

# Embedded software

## Environment

The embedded software was developed under **MPLABX IDE V5.40** and **XC8 V2.20** compiler.

## Target
The SPRD board is based on a 8-bits PIC microcontroller: the PIC12LF1571.
